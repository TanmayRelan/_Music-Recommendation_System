# Precision-Driven Music Genre Clustering System

## Overview

The Precision-Driven Music Genre Clustering System is designed to improve music discovery and recommendation by utilizing K-means clustering on Spotify's dataset. This project clusters songs based on genre similarities, providing users with more personalized and relevant music suggestions.

## Tools

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**

## Key Tasks

### Data Analysis and Preparation

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured high-quality input data through thorough cleaning, including handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracted relevant features from the dataset and normalized them to prepare for effective clustering.

### Clustering System Development

- **K-means Clustering:** Applied K-means clustering algorithm to group songs based on genre similarities. K-means is an iterative algorithm that partitions data into \( k \) clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The process involves:
  - **Initialization:** Selecting \( k \) initial centroids (cluster centers).
  - **Assignment:** Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.
  - **Update:** Recalculating centroids based on the mean of assigned data points.
  - **Iteration:** Repeating the assignment and update steps until convergence.

- **Parameter Tuning:** Optimized the number of clusters \( k \) and other parameters to achieve the best clustering results and enhance genre classification accuracy.

### Evaluation and Enhancement

- **Performance Assessment:** Evaluated the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score and inertia, which measure how well the clusters are formed.
- **System Refinement:** Improved the clustering system based on evaluation results, adjusting parameters and refining the model to enhance accuracy and user engagement.

## Outcome

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Successfully improved music discovery by providing more tailored and relevant music recommendations based on genre similarities.
- **Precision-Driven Classification:** Demonstrated expertise in data clustering techniques, leading to accurate and reliable genre classification.
